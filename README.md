#Hangman-Game

This program is a text-based Hangman game implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows a user to guess letters of a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts. If the user makes too many incorrect guesses, the game ends in failure and displays a hangman figure.
